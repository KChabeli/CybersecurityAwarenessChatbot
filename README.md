# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot — a fun and interactive console app I built using C# and .NET. The goal? To make learning about cybersecurity a little more engaging, especially for beginners.

## 💡 What's it all about?

This chatbot has a simple job: chat with you about online safety in a friendly, easy-to-understand way. It kicks off with a voice greeting, shows you a cool ASCII lock logo, then jumps into a conversation about topics like:

- 🔐 Creating strong passwords  
- 🚨 Spotting phishing attempts  
- 🌐 Staying safe while browsing the internet

It even remembers your name during the chat, making it feel a bit more personal.

## 🧩 How it works

Once you run the app, here’s what happens:

1. 🎙️ A voice greeting plays (as long as `greeting.wav` is in the right spot)
2. 🧱 An ASCII lock graphic shows up in the console
3. 🧑 You’re asked your name, then guided into a friendly chat
4. 💬 Ask questions like "what is phishing?" or "how to create a good password"

The chatbot uses basic logic to give useful answers and tries to be helpful if it doesn’t understand your question.
